            My name is Jordan Hanson. I am 26 years old. I was born in Salt Lake City, but raised in small town Central
            Valley. I grew up riding and training horses at a very young age. I have since carried that into my adult
            life until about two years ago when my horse suffered a career ending injury in Texas. I am a Mom of three
            intelligent little humans that drive me crazy, but you can't help but love them always no matter the mess
            they made that day. I enjoy reading books and watching documentaries, so hit me up with your reading lists.
            I am currently watching a documenary about OJ Simpson, and reading Good to Great by Jim C. Collins.

            I currently work in finance with Entrata for the last year. I only work there one night a week for the
            reason being I am a full time student and in this
            bootcamp, so busy is my life! I am excited about this career path for the active
            learning lifestyle. I like to learn new projects an conquer them in depth. This career gives my personality
            that option and benefit my skill set. I hope to learn a new language one after the other in my career as a
            Full Stack Developer.
